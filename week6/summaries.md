**Keywords**: Agile project management; Situational awareness; Estimation; Progress tracking; Predictions; Risk identification; Plan adjustment
**Summary**: George Dinwiddie gave a speech titled "Are We There Yet? Agile Situational Awareness Using Estimation" at DCSUG. In the speech, he discussed the importance of estimation in agile project management and how it can help teams develop situational awareness, which is the ability to understand where a project stands in relation to its goals. He explained how estimation can be used to track progress and make predictions, and how it can also help teams identify potential risks and adjust their plans accordingly. Dinwiddie emphasized that while estimation is not always accurate, it is still an important tool for agile teams to develop situational awareness and make informed decisions.
**Opinions**: For strengths, I think the speaker used real-life examples and case studies to illustrate his points, which made the speech more engaging and relatable for the audience; for weakness, I think the speaker may have been constrained by time, which may have limited the depth of discussion and prevented the speaker from addressing all audience questions and concerns.
