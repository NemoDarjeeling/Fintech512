Once you have cloned (or forked) the directory, cd into the 'code' directory and compare the examples in the numbered directories with the exposition in the [book chapter](http://www.aosabook.org/en/500L/a-simple-web-server.html) and with the web technology slides. In particular, 04-cgi is worth careful study.
