Title: 'What Are Requirements' chapter in Mastering the Requirements Process; https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-the-requirements/0321419499/ch01.html#ch01
Keywords: requirement gathering; system modeling; agile software development (rabbit, horse, and elephant); functional requirement; nonfunctional requirement; constraints; requirement evolution; requirement template; shell; Volere process
Summary: This chapter provides an overview of the concept of requirements and their importance to the software development process. The chapter explains that requirements are descriptions of what a system or product must do or have in order to meet the needs of the people involved. It also emphasizes the importance of clear and unambiguous requirements to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget and that the final product meets the needs of the users. In addition, the chapter describes the different types of requirements, such as functional and nonfunctional, and the different ways in which requirements can be captured and documented, for instance, shell and Volere requirement process.
Opinion: For the strength of this article, first, the illustration about the requirement is detailed and clear, the author explained the process to gather requirement, necessity of requirement and categories of requirement, which is helpful for readers to understand the different aspect of requirements management; second, the analogy of rabbit, horse and elephant is vivid enough for readers to understand the importance of categorize the requirements and distinguish which very type they are facing; third, it is very helpful and practical to provide readers with the template and remind us what information about the requirement is worth gathering, making it easier for us to start. For the weakness, it might be a lack of actual examples: the chapter may lack practical examples and case studies which could have helped readers understand the concept better.

Title: Original CRC Card paper, 'A Laboratory for Teaching Object-Oriented Thinking'; https://sakai.duke.edu/access/content/group/FINTECH-512-02-Sp23/Papers/Beck%20-%20%20A%20Laboratory%20For%20Teaching%20Object-Oriented%20Thinking.pdf
Keywords: Class-Responsibility-Collaboration (CRC) card; object-oriented system; physical interaction; responsibilities and collaborations; laboratory setting; context based
Summary: This paper describes the Class-Responsibility-Cooperation (CRC) Cards method, a method for teaching object-oriented design. The paper presents the CRC cards method as a way to learn object-oriented design principles through hands-on experience. The method involves creating a physical card for each class in the system and displaying the name, responsibilities and relationship of the class on the map, proving that the CRC card approach is effective in teaching students to define and model classes, responsibilities and collaboration, and to think in terms of objects and their interactions. It also describes how this method can be used in the lab to give students hands-on, interactive experience in object-oriented design.
Opinion: For the paper, the strength might be that the author presented very vivd examples about of how the method was used in a laboratory setting, for instance descriptions of "Thinking with Objects". It gave us a clear and practical image of how CRC should be used and its strength; the weakness might be that the paper fails to present comparisons of the CRC card method with other existing approaches for teaching OOD, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. For CRC cards method itself, the strength might be it is a simple, easy-to-use, lightweight and informal technique, which makes it possible for students to understand the essence of OOD quickly and easily; however, the downside of it might be it is not directly linked to code, so students have to spend sometime to apply OOD in actual coding; and it is heavily context-based, looking at the cards at home by oneself is probably not an effective way to use CRC to learn OOD.
