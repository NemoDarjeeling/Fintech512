#In Python, we don't have a built-in keyword like "protected" in Java, but we have a convention to use a single leading underscore (_) before the name of an attribute or method to indicate that it is intended for internal use and should not be accessed from outside the class. 
class Money:

    #notice no more type checks here, only value checks (trap)
    #now we add type check, noticeIt is not correct to replace "return self._amount == other._amount and type(self) == type(other)" with "return isinstance(self, other) and self._amount == other._amount" 
    #The intended behavior of the code is to check if two objects are of the same class and have the same value for the attribute '_amount'. The proposed replacement "return isinstance(self, other) and self._amount == other._amount" only check if the two objects are instances of the same class and have the same value for the attribute '_amount'.
