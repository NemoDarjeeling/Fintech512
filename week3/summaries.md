Title: On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules; https://sakai.duke.edu/access/content/group/FINTECH-512-02-Sp22/Papers/On%20the%20Criteria%20To%20Be%20Used%20in%20Decomposing%20Systems%20into%20Modules%20Parnas.pdf; https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/05/on-the-criteria-to-be-used-in-decomposing-systems-into-modules/
Keywords: Decomposing systems; Modules; Criteria; Ease of change; Reusability; Interactions; Functionality; Human factors
Summary: It is a paper by David Parnas that discusses the criteria that should be used when decomposing a system into smaller, more manageable components, known as modules. The paper argues that the primary criteria for decomposition should be the ease with which changes can be made to the system, as well as the ability to reuse components in other systems. Additionally, the paper suggests that the interactions between components should be minimized and that the functionality of each module should be well-defined. The paper also highlights the importance of considering the human factors involved in system design, such as the ability of developers to understand and work with the system.
Opinion: For the strength, it highlights the importance of considering human factors: The paper suggests that the human factors involved in system design, such as the ability of developers to understand and work with the system, should also be taken into account. For the weakness, it does not explain how the criteria should be implemented, which could make it difficult for readers to apply the concepts in practice.

Title: Rediscovering Simplicity; https://sandimetz.com/99bottles-sample-js#chapter-rediscovering-simplicity
Keywords: Simplicity; Software design; Complexity; SOLID; DRY; YAGNI; Maintainability; Codebase
Summary: This chapter discusses the importance of simplicity in software design. It argues that simple code is easier to understand, maintain, and extend, and that it is more likely to be correct. The chapter also discusses how complexity can creep into a system over time, and how to identify and eliminate unnecessary complexity. It suggests that good design principles such as SOLID, DRY, and YAGNI can help to keep a codebase simple. Additionally, the chapter also mentions that developers should strive to focus on the problem at hand and not over-engineer solutions, also known as "YAGNI" (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principle.
Opinion: For the strength, it emphasizes the importance of simplicity in software design and development, and how it can improve the maintainability and extensibility of a system. For the weakness, it may not provide enough detail on how to implement the concepts discussed in a real-world setting.

Title: Modern Code Review; https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/making-software/9780596808310/ch18.html
Keywords: Code review; Software development; Collaboration; Quality assurance; Pull requests; Continuous integration; Peer review; Constructive feedback
Summary: The chapter discusses the best practices and techniques for code review in modern software development. It covers the benefits of code review, such as improved code quality, better collaboration, and knowledge sharing among developers. It also covers different code review methods, such as pair programming, formal code review, and continuous integration. The chapter also emphasizes on the importance of using tools like pull requests and code review software to automate the process and facilitate collaboration. Additionally, the chapter also covers how to handle common challenges that arise during code reviews, such as dealing with conflicting feedback, handling sensitive code and how to give and receive constructive feedback.
Opinion: For the strength, it covers how to handle common challenges that arise during code reviews, such as dealing with conflicting feedback, handling sensitive code and how to give and receive constructive feedback. For the weakness, it may not take into account the specific needs and constraints of different types of organizations or projects.
