**Summary:**  
Chapter 6 of "The Pragmatic Programmer" discusses the advantages and difficulties of concurrency in the development of software. Locking, synchronization, message passing, and shared-memory concurrency are all methods for handling concurrency. Using thread-safe data structures and avoiding the use of global variables are two suggestions for debugging concurrent programs. The emphasis is on designing for concurrency from the outset, with recommendations such adopting functional programming and designing for immutability.
