4, 30, no big difference to create route and function, but what to render is a big problem, because I don't have a python version of htmlStatement()

7, 65, nightmare came when I have to create a static folder to contain all data files and index.js, it just won't work to connect to index.js by just copying the original charting folder into template folder, I have to reorganize the configuration and change some link in examples.py, index.js and index.html, might be that I'm using js rather than py to organize the stockchart app
