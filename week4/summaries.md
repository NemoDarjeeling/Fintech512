### Title: [Kevlin Henney - The SOLID Design Principles Deconstructed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMW08JkFrBA)  
Keywords: SOLID design principles, software development, purpose, benefits, limitations, practical examples  
Summary: Kevlin Henney provides a comprehensive overview and critique of the five SOLID design principles in software development. He explains the purpose, benefits, and limitations of each principle, and provides practical examples to illustrate his points. For SRP, there are many cases that it is violated, for instance, cost(cheaper for a clustered class), measure(3 normal classes vs. 3 2000-line classes), utility-reality(stdlib), change not usage. For ISP, he argued if one can faithfully implement SRP, he/she should have implemented ISP as well. For LSP, sometimes "inheritance" patterns are found in non-inheritance relationships, and B.L was just providing examples, not doctorine. For OCP, unchanged != compatible, so it is not really the right principle for OOP(it's actually more related to data framework); and publish != public, I can change whatever I want for latter but not for former. For DIP, it is useful.  
Opinion: The strength of this speech might be clear and concise explanations of each SOLID design principle, and critique of the limitations of each principle with very concrete examples. The weakness might be the speech may not have provided enough in-depth information or practical solutions: what should we rely on if SOLID has been somewhat disproven?
