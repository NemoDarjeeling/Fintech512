### Choose which kinds of questions to ask
Closed questions;(How many years of C experience do you have?)  
Open-ended questions;(Tell me about your current job.)  
Behavior-description questions;(Do you ever have to release products before you’ve been able to perform enough testing? If yes, How do you decide what to do?)
### Beware of leading questions
"You helped, didn’t you?"
### Hypothetical questions
"Suppose you are Superman, what will you do if..."
### Do not use puzzles or riddles, especially if you are looking for great problem-solvers
How would you move Mt Fuji?
### Assess Problem-Solving Skills with Behavior-Description Questions
Tell me about a design problem that you solved that you are proud of.  
How long did it take you to solve the problem?  
How did you know the problem was fixed?  
Tell me what you have done in the past to test the product.  
How have you learned about the product?  
### Schedule auditions to allow candidates to demonstrate their abilities
### Create auditions by selecting the behaviors you want to see
Debugging: I show the candidate a software product in development, including a piece of the code, and ask him or her to solve a problem that I tell the candidate already exists in the code.   
### Formulate a set of meta-questions
“What haven’t I asked you to talk about that I should have?”  
“If I were to ask you a question for which an honest answer would make you look less qualified for this job, how would you answer?”   
### Avoid asking irrelevant questions
"Where do you want to be in five years?”  
“If you could change just one thing, what would it be?”  
### Combine question types to make the best use of available time
...use my interview time best when I ask closed questions to establish the facts; follow up with behavior-oriented, open-ended questions; and then end with an audition.  
### Ask questions to reveal cultural fit
  
closed questions:  
1. What was your major as an undergraduate?
2. Which field do you consider yourself have more experience in, finance, programming, statistics, or web/app design?
3. How long have you been using each language/tool below: python, flaskr, javascript, SQL, html, css? 
open-ended questions:  
4. Tell me about your most recent programming project, what was it about and how did you contribute to it?
behavior-description questions:  
5. For your most recent programming project, how did you allocated your time spent on it? If you approximately allocated the time equally during each period, tell me more about your schedule. If you completed almost everything just before DDL, would you want to revise your schedule in next project, and why?
6. During your last teamwork experience, did you consider it difficult to work in the team? If yes, what would you identify as the biggest obstacle for you to work as a team member in that experience? If no, what do you think you have done to boost such productive teamwork?
[audition:(data process related, python required, but just an example...)]  
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it. You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.
